<h1>Alan Turing</h1>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman">Alan Turing (23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was a British genius. He has lots of precious article and technical inventions about computer science and mathematician. Germans were using Enigma machine (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine/">Figure  1</a>) which was invedted to comminication for army in Second World War. They could send cipher text each other owing to this machine.The English were trying to broke the Enigma code and Turing volunteered for this work. Then, he led participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park, during the Second World War. As a result of this work, Turing invented the Bomble Machine(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe">Figure 2</a>) and The English could broke Enigma code. </font></p>
<p><font face="TimesNewRoman">On the other hand, when Turing was working at the University of  Manchester, he wondered that can machines think like humans, or not.  Turing suggested artificial intelligence and he improved “Turing test”. The idea was that, can computer convience people it was a human? İf it was possible, computers can think like a human. Therefore, Turing  is considered the founder of computer science</font></p>
